# Random User Cards Generator

## Overview

The **Random User Cards Generator** is a web application that dynamically fetches and displays random user profiles as interactive cards. This project demonstrates how to consume public APIs, manipulate the DOM, and create visually appealing user interfaces using JavaScript.

## Features

- Fetches random user data from an external API
- Dynamically generates user cards with profile details
- Responsive and interactive UI
- Refreshes user cards on demand

## Core JavaScript Concepts Used

This project helped reinforce the following JavaScript concepts:

- **Fetch API:** Used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to retrieve user data.
- **Promises & Async/Await:** Managed asynchronous operations for cleaner, more readable code.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically created and updated HTML elements based on fetched data.
- **Event Handling:** Listened for user interactions (e.g., button clicks) to trigger data refresh.
- **Template Literals:** Built HTML structures efficiently with embedded JavaScript expressions.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented try/catch blocks to gracefully handle API errors.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click the "Generate" button to fetch and display random user cards.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Integrate third-party APIs into web applications
- Handle asynchronous data fetching and UI updates
- Structure JavaScript code for maintainability and clarity
